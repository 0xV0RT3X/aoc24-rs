This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges implemented in Rust. Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place in December, providing a series of programming puzzles to solve.

## 🌟 Introduction
Advent of Code is a fantastic platform to enhance your problem-solving and coding skills. This repository aims to share clean, efficient, and well-documented solutions to the challenges posed during the Advent of Code 2024 event, all implemented in the Rust programming language.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and adapt it to your own solutions. If you have any suggestions or improvements, don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request!

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run these solutions on your local machine, make sure you have Rust installed. You can find instructions on how to install Rust on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xV0RT3X/aoc24-rs.git
```
Navigate to the specific day's folder: 
```
cd aoc24-rs/dayXX
```
Run the Rust file:
```
cargo run
```

## 📁 Structure
The repository is structured by days, with each day containing a Rust file (main.rs) for the puzzle's solution. Additionally, there might be input files specific to each day.

```
aoc24-rs/
│
├── day01/
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── main.rs
│
├── day02/
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── main.rs
